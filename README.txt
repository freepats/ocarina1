Ocarina
-------

Version 2024-10-02

This sound bank has been created from real instrument recordings, thanks to Xavimart (Javier), a musician that maintains a collection of musical instruments from many places around the world. He granted us access to his collection and helped with the performance and recording for all day long.

The ocarina was recorded on January 2019 by Xavimart, Gonzalo <humanogonzalo@gmail.com> and Roberto <roberto@zenvoid.org>, with two Zoom H1 portable recorders.
